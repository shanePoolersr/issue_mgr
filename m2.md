# Mini Challenge 2

## Full CRUD(S) support for issues

### Acceptance Criteria
1. It is possible to create new issues.
2. It is possible to view a "detail page" for an issue.
3. It is possible to update new issues.
4. It is possible to delete new issues.
5. It is possible to view a list of all issues.

## Note:
For number 5, you can simply list them as an unordered list for now, or if you want to
go the extra mile, start working on the format to have the 3 columns we discussed:
1. To do
2. In progress
3. Done
